# EnderIOFusion
Adds recipes for Simple Ores 2's thyrium and sinisite chunks to EnderIO's alloy smelter.

Just copy-paste-replace the file into your enderio config folder.

No bronze or steel. I cannot get bronze to work in the alloy smelter, at least while I'm allowing it to use the ThermalExpansion bronze recipes. Maybe if I disable those.

Adding support for TheOldOne's nether alloys and akkamaddi's add-ons in the future. Will attempt bronze and steel again in the future, as well.
